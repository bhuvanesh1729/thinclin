```

## How It Works

1. **Installation**: The script installs and configures:
   - XRDP (Remote Desktop Protocol server)
   - XFCE4 (Desktop Environment)
   - LocalTunnel (for remote access)
   - Required system services

2. **Configuration**:
   - Sets up XRDP to use port 1431
   - Configures XFCE4 as the desktop environment
   - Creates and starts LocalTunnel service
   - Sets up proper firewall rules

3. **Access**:
   - Generates a unique LocalTunnel URL
   - Allows RDP connections through this URL
   - Supports Windows, macOS, and Linux clients

## System Requirements

- **CPU**: 1+ cores
- **RAM**: 2GB minimum (4GB recommended)
- **Storage**: 2GB free space
- **Network**: Stable internet connection

## Troubleshooting

1. **Check service status**:
```bash
systemctl status xrdp
systemctl status thinclin-tunnel
```

2. **View LocalTunnel URL**:
```bash
journalctl -u thinclin-tunnel.service | grep "your url is"
```

3. **Check logs**:
```bash
journalctl -u xrdp
journalctl -u thinclin-tunnel
```

## Security Considerations

- Change default user password
- Keep system updated
- Monitor access logs
- Configure firewall rules
- Use strong authentication
- Consider SSL setup for additional security
